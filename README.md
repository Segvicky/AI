# A function for calculating the location entropy of a give dataset
# I wrote a python function to calculate entropy
# I went to https://www.protectedplanet.net/ to download a csv file of World database of protected areas(WDPA)      https://www.protectedplanet.net/downloads/WDPA_Sept2018?type=csv
# Fed the csv file into python where the analysis was done
# I used a jupyter notebook as my python console.
