 ## Calculation of Entropy location 

**A function for calculating the location entropy of a given dataset  (https://github.com/Segvicky/AI/assets/24966734/0f0ee1e2-d6e7-4613-9f30-bac047079249)
I wrote a python function to calculate entropy

I went to https://www.protectedplanet.net/ to download a csv file of World database of protected areas(WDPA)      

https://www.protectedplanet.net/downloads/WDPA_Sept2018?type=csv

Fed the csv file into python where the analysis was done
I used a jupyter notebook as my python console.
